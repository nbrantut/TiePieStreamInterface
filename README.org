* Tie Pie Streaming Interface

GUI to control TiePie oscilloscopes in streaming mode. Made with Python3 and tkinter.

Dependencies: libtiepie.

This code is quick and dirty but seems to work fine for the intended purpose. It is heavily inspired by the "cecchi leach" interface from ASC Ltd.

Usage: python interface.py

The GUI should be more or less self-explanatory. Be careful when using the watch, as it may result in data overflow. Same thing with using CSV file format: it is slow and is very limited.

You can save configuration file (as .txt) and load it to save time.
